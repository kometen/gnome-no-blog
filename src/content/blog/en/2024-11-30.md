One of Rust's core strengths is it's ownership model. It is very strict about who owns a variable at any
given time, which many newcomers like me have learned. The learning curve can be very steep.
For this reason Rust will usually not be the first programming language people will use since it appears so
unforgiven for even small mistakes.

The ownership model though is also the reason why Rust is a more difficult target for hackers when they want
to gain access to a program. So I asked Claude whether my non-technical exlanation was correct. And asked it
if it would provide three reasons why Rust stands out. And of course it was glad to do so. Here is the response:

1. **Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection**
   - The ownership system you mentioned is key to this
   - Prevents common bugs like buffer overflows and data races at compile time
   - You get the safety of languages like Java but without the performance overhead of garbage collection

2. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**
   - You can write high-level, clean code that compiles down to efficient machine code
   - "If you don't use it, you don't pay for it" - you only pay for what you actually use
   - Allows writing safe, readable code without sacrificing performance

3. **Modern Developer Experience**
   - Excellent package manager (Cargo)
   - Helpful compiler error messages that actually guide you to solutions
   - Built-in testing, documentation, and dependency management
   - Strong community and growing ecosystem
